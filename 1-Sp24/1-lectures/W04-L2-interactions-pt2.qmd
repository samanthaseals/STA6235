## Introduction {background-image="/Users/sseals/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-sseals@uwf.edu/My Drive/00 - Personal/R/quarto themes/slide.png" background-size="contain"} 

- Recall the general linear model, 

$$ y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + ... + \beta_k x_k + \varepsilon $$

- Last lecture, we begain talking about interactions and focused on continuous $\times$ continuous interactions.

    - e.g., $x_1 \times x_2$
    
- Today, we will begin talking about interactions with categorical variables.

## Interactions with Categorical Variables {background-image="/Users/sseals/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-sseals@uwf.edu/My Drive/00 - Personal/R/quarto themes/slide.png" background-size="contain"} 

- Recall that if a categorical predictor with $c$ classes is included in the model, we will include $c-1$ terms to represent it.

- This holds true for interactions: 

    - Categorical $\times$ categorical: $(c_1-1)(c_2-1)$
    
    - Categorical $\times$ continuous: $(c-1)(1)$

- Note that a special (and easy!) case is when our categorical variable is binary: $c-1 = 1$.

- Consider factor A, with 3 levels, and factor B, with 4 levels.

    - 2 $\times$ 3 = 6 terms in the model ðŸ˜¬

## Data Management

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(fastDummies)
ratings <- read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2022/2022-01-25/ratings.csv')
details <- read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2022/2022-01-25/details.csv')
analytic <- full_join(ratings, details, by = "id") %>% 
  filter(playingtime <= 300 & # â‰¤ 300 min
         playingtime > 0 & # > 0 min
         year > 1900 & # filter out games without years
         year < 2024 & # filter out games with too large of years
         minplayers > 0) %>% # require at least 1 player for game
  mutate(play60 = playingtime/60) %>%
  select(id, name, year, average, play60, minplayers) %>%
  mutate(year2013 = if_else(year >= 2013, 1, 0),
         play_hours = case_when(play60 <= 1 ~ 1,
                                play60 > 1 & play60 <= 2 ~ 2,
                                play60 > 2 & play60 <= 3 ~ 3,
                                play60 > 3 & play60 <= 4 ~ 4,
                                play60 > 4 & play60 <= 5 ~ 5),
         play_home = if_else(minplayers <= 2, 1, 0)) %>%
  dummy_cols(select_columns = "play_hours") %>%

```

## Resulting Data

## Example {background-image="/Users/sseals/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-sseals@uwf.edu/My Drive/00 - Personal/R/quarto themes/slide.png" background-size="contain"} 

- Let's model the average rating as a function of if the game was made in the last 10 years (*year2013*), if I can play it at home (*play_home*), the length of game play (*play_hours* - categorical!), the interaction between if I can play it at home and if the game was made in the last 10 years, and the interaction between if I can play it at home and the length of game play.

## Model
```{r}
m1 <- lm(average ~ year2013 + play_home + play_hours_2 + play_hours_3 + play_hours_4 + play_hours_5 +
           play_home:year2013 + # interaction between play_home and year2013
           play_home:play_hours_2 + play_home:play_hours_3 + play_home:play_hours_4 + play_home:play_hours_5, # interaction between play_home and play_hours
         data = analytic) 
```

## Results

```{r}
summary(m1)
```

## Testing Categorical $\times$ Categorical Interactions {background-image="/Users/sseals/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-sseals@uwf.edu/My Drive/00 - Personal/R/quarto themes/slide.png" background-size="contain"} 

- As we see in the model, a categorical $\times$ categorical interaction results in $(c_1-1)(c_2-1)$ terms.

    - In our example, `play_home` $\times$ `play_hours` results in 4 terms.
    
- If we want to know if the interaction - overall - is significant, then we must perform the partial F test.

    - Note 1: we use the `car::Anova()` function for this.
    
    - Note 2: for correct results, the `car::Anova()` function requires a *single* variable, rather than $c-1$ indicators.
        
- Remember, in the case of binary $\times$ binary *or* binary $\times$ continuous interactions, we can use the results from `summary()`.

## Example - Testing {background-image="/Users/sseals/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-sseals@uwf.edu/My Drive/00 - Personal/R/quarto themes/slide.png" background-size="contain"} 

- Let's determine which interactions are significant.

::: {.panel-tabset}

## `year2013` $\times$ `play_home` 

```{r}
summary(m1)
```

## `play_hours` $\times$ `play_home` (oops)

```{r}
tail(car::Anova(m1, type = 3))
# NOTE! I am using tail() because the results run off of the slide
# You do not need to use the tail() function in your project
```

## `play_hours` $\times$ `play_home` (correct)

```{r}
#| echo: false
m2 <- lm(average ~ year2013 + play_home + as.factor(play_hours) +
                   play_home:year2013 + # interaction between play_home and year2013
                   play_home:as.factor(play_hours), # interaction between play_home and play_hours
         data = analytic) 

car::Anova(m2, type = 3)
```

## Simplifying Models {background-image="/Users/sseals/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-sseals@uwf.edu/My Drive/00 - Personal/R/quarto themes/slide.png" background-size="contain"}    

- Like before, we can plug in values to simplify our model.

## Set Up

$$
\begin{align*}
\hat{y} &= 5.95 + 0.46 \text{ year2013} - 0.06 \text{ play\_home} + \\
& 0.34 \text{ play\_hours\_2} + 0.73 \text{ play\_hours\_3} + 0.88 \text{ play\_hours\_4} + 1.27 \text{ play\_hours\_5} + \\
& 0.30 \text{ year2013} \times \text{play\_home} + \\

& 0.02 \text{ play\_home} \times \text{ play\_hours\_4} - 0.44 \text{ play\_home} \times \text{ play\_hours\_5}

$$

- Let's separate into two models: 

    - one for games that I can play at home (minimum player count of no more than 2 players); play_home = 1, 
    - and another for games I cannot play at home (minimum player count of 3 or more); play_home=0.
    
## play_home=1

$$

& 0.02 (1) \times \text{ play\_hours\_4} - 0.44 (1) \times \text{ play\_hours\_5} \\
=& 5.89 + 0.76 \text{ year2013}  + \\

\end{align*}
$$

## play_home=0

$$
\begin{align*}
\hat{y} =& 5.95 + 0.46 \text{ year2013} - 0.06 (0) + \\

& 0.18 (0) \times \text{ play\_hours\_2} + 0.06 (0) \times \text{ play\_hours\_3} \\
& 0.02 (0) \times \text{ play\_hours\_4} - 0.44 (0) \times \text{ play\_hours\_5} \\
=& 5.95 + 0.46 \text{ year2013} + \\
& 0.34 \text{ play\_hours\_2} + 0.73 \text{ play\_hours\_3} + 0.88 \text{ play\_hours\_4} + 1.27 \text{ play\_hours\_5}

- What we have learned about interactions holds true *regardless* of the type of modeling we are doing.

    - We may not explicitly talk about interactions in the future, however, it is valid to be asked to include them in models.

- Remember for testing interactions: 

    - `summary()` 
    
        - overall for continuous $\times$ continuous
        - overall for binary $\times$ continuous
        - pairwise comparisons against the reference group(s)
    
    - `car::Anova()` 
    
        - overall for categorical ($c\ge3$) $\times$ continuous
        - overall for categorical ($c\ge3$) $\times$ categorical ($c\ge2$)
