## Introduction {background-image="/Users/sseals/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-sseals@uwf.edu/My Drive/00 - Personal/R/quarto themes/slide.png" background-size="contain"} 

- Recall the general linear model, 

$$ y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + ... + \beta_k x_k + \varepsilon $$

- Until now, we have talked about models with only main effects.

    - e.g., $x_1$, $x_2$

- Today, we will begin talking about interactions.

    - e.g., $x_1 \times x_2$

## Interactions {background-image="/Users/sseals/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-sseals@uwf.edu/My Drive/00 - Personal/R/quarto themes/slide.png" background-size="contain"} 

- Recall interactions from two-way ANOVA:

    - The relationship between the outcome and one predictor depends on the level of another predictor.

- Interactions work (and are specified) the same way in regression. 

- The usual caveats apply:

    - We do not want to load models with too many interactions.
    
    - We favor simplicity over interactions that do not add much to the predictive power of the model.

    - We do not want higher than two-way interactions unless necessary.
    
- Today we will focus on continuous $\times$ continuous interactions.

## Interactions {background-image="/Users/sseals/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-sseals@uwf.edu/My Drive/00 - Personal/R/quarto themes/slide.png" background-size="contain"} 

- We will construct what is called a hierarchical well-formulated (HWF) model. 
- This means that when a higher-order interaction term is included in the model, all lower-order terms are also included.

- e.g., when a two-way interaction is included, we also include the corresponding main effects.

$$y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \beta_3 x_1 x_2$$

- e.g., when a three-way interaction is included, we also include the corresponding main effects and two-way interactions.

$$y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \beta_3 x_3 + \beta_4 x_1 x_2 + \beta_5 x_1 x_3 + \beta_6 x_2 x_3 + \beta_7 x_1 x_2 x_3$$

- We now will perform some data cleaning.

    - Limit playing time to (0, 300]
    
    - Limit years to (1900, 2024)
    
    - Limit number of players to [1, $\infty$)

         year > 1900 & # filter out games without years
         year < 2024 & # filter out games with too large of years

- Suppose we weren't actually interested in year as a predictor. Then,

::: {.panel-tabset}

## Model

         data = analytic)

## Example - Model {background-image="/Users/sseals/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-sseals@uwf.edu/My Drive/00 - Personal/R/quarto themes/slide.png" background-size="contain"} 

- I personally do not want to interpret playing time in terms of a 1 minute increase, so I will scale it by 60 minutes (so, 1 hour increments)

::: {.panel-tabset}

## Scaling
```{r}
analytic <- analytic %>% 
  mutate(play60 = playingtime/60)
```

## Model

```{r}
m4 <- lm(average ~ minplayers + play60 + minplayers:play60, 
         data = analytic)
```

## Results

```{r}
summary(m4)
```

:::

## Example - Model {background-image="/Users/sseals/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-sseals@uwf.edu/My Drive/00 - Personal/R/quarto themes/slide.png" background-size="contain"} 

- Thus, our model is as follows,

```{r}
coefficients(m4)
```

$$\hat{\text{rating}} = 6.46 -0.17 \text{ min. players} + 0.32 \text{ time} - 0.02 \text{ min. players $\times$ time}$$

- ... how do we interpret the interaction?

- Note that we cannot interpret the main effects of the interaction term

    - i.e., we cannot interpret *minimum player count* and *playing time* alone.
    

## Example - Model Dissection {background-image="/Users/sseals/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-sseals@uwf.edu/My Drive/00 - Personal/R/quarto themes/slide.png" background-size="contain"} 

- If we look at the interaction term,

```{r}
coefficients(m4)["minplayers:play60"]
```

- One general interpretation is that as playing time increases, the slope describing the relationship between average rating and minimum player count decreases.

- The other general interpretation is that as minimum player count increases, the slope describing the relationship between average rating and playing time decreases.

## Example - Simplifying Model {background-image="/Users/sseals/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-sseals@uwf.edu/My Drive/00 - Personal/R/quarto themes/slide.png" background-size="contain"} 

- For visualization purposes, we will plug in values and reduce down.

::: {.panel-tabset}

## Min. 2 players

- Let's plug in for a minimum player count of 2.

$$
\begin{align*}
\hat{\text{rating}} &= 6.46 -0.17 \text{ min. players} + 0.32 \text{ time} - 0.02 \text{ min. players $\times$ time} \\
&= 6.46  -0.17(2) + 0.32 \text{ time} - 0.02 (2) \text{ time} \\
&= 6.46  -0.34 + 0.32 \text{ time} - 0.04 \text{ time} \\
&= (6.46 -0.34)   + (0.32  - 0.04) \text{ time} \\
&= 6.12 + 0.28 \text{ time}
\end{align*}
$$

## Min. 4 players

- Let's plug in for a minimum player count of 4.

$$
\begin{align*}
\hat{\text{rating}} &= 6.46 -0.17 \text{ min. players} + 0.32 \text{ time} - 0.02 \text{ min. players $\times$ time} \\
&= 6.46  -0.17(4) + 0.32 \text{ time} - 0.02 (4) \text{ time} \\
&= 6.46  -0.68 + 0.32 \text{ time} - 0.08 \text{ time} \\
&= (6.46 -0.68)   + (0.32  - 0.08) \text{ time} \\
&= 5.78 + 0.24 \text{ time}
\end{align*}
$$

## Simplified Models

- Thus, we have the two models,

$$
\begin{align*}
\hat{\text{rating}}_{\text{player = 2}} &= 6.12 + 0.28 \text{ time} \\
\hat{\text{rating}}_{\text{player = 4}} &= 5.78 + 0.24 \text{ time}
\end{align*}
$$

## Interpretations {background-image="/Users/sseals/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-sseals@uwf.edu/My Drive/00 - Personal/R/quarto themes/slide.png" background-size="contain"} 

::: {.panel-tabset}

## Notes

- Interaction terms are tricky with interpretations.

- To interpret the interaction, remember that the relationship between the outcome and one predictor depends on the level of a second predictor.

    - The interaction term itself gives you an idea of what's happening.
    
    - We can also provide proper interpretations once we simplify the model.
    
## Model with Interaction

$$\hat{\text{rating}} = 6.46 -0.17 \text{ min. players} + 0.32 \text{ time} - 0.02 \text{ min. players $\times$ time}$$

- As minimum player count increases, the slope describing the relationship between average rating and playing time decreases by 0.02 rating points.
    
## Simplified Models

$$
\begin{align*}
\hat{\text{rating}}_{\text{player = 2}} &= 6.12 + 0.28 \text{ time} \\
\hat{\text{rating}}_{\text{player = 4}} &= 5.78 + 0.24 \text{ time}
\end{align*}
$$

- When looking at a 2 player game, for every hour increase in time-to-play, the game's rating increases by 0.28 rating points.

- When looking at a 4 player game, for every hour increase in time-to-play, the game's rating increases by 0.24 rating points.

## Example - Predicted Values {background-image="/Users/sseals/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-sseals@uwf.edu/My Drive/00 - Personal/R/quarto themes/slide.png" background-size="contain"} 

- We want to create a visualization for our model.

    - We have "taken care of" the interaction by plugging in values for minimum player count.
    
- We need to decide what goes on the *x*-axis.

    - In this (very simplistic) example, we only have one variable - playing time in hours.

    - In other, more complicated models, we will have to choose one to allow to vary (and include it on the *x*-axis), then create predicted values while holding everything else in the model constant.

## Interactions with Categorical Variables {background-image="/Users/sseals/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-sseals@uwf.edu/My Drive/00 - Personal/R/quarto themes/slide.png" background-size="contain"} 

- Recall that if a categorical predictor with $c$ classes is included in the model, we will include $c-1$ terms to represent it.

- This holds true for interactions: 

    - Categorical $\times$ categorical: $(c_1-1)(c_2-1)$
    
    - Categorical $\times$ continuous: $(c-1)(1)$

- Note that a special (and easy!) case is when our categorical variable is binary: $c-1 = 1$.

- Consider factor A, with 3 levels, and factor B, with 4 levels.

    - 2 $\times$ 3 = 6 terms in the model ðŸ˜¬

## Testing Categorical $\times$ Categorical Interactions {background-image="/Users/sseals/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-sseals@uwf.edu/My Drive/00 - Personal/R/quarto themes/slide.png" background-size="contain"} 

- As we see in the model, a categorical $\times$ categorical interaction results in $(c_1-1)(c_2-1)$ terms.

    - In our example, `play_home` $\times$ `play_hours` results in 4 terms.
    
- If we want to know if the interaction - overall - is significant, then we must perform the partial F test.

    - Note 1: we use the `car::Anova()` function for this.
    
    - Note 2: for correct results, the `car::Anova()` function requires a *single* variable, rather than $c-1$ indicators.
        
- Remember, in the case of binary $\times$ binary *or* binary $\times$ continuous interactions, we can use the results from `summary()`.

## Set Up

$$
\begin{align*}

& 0.34 \text{ play\_hours\_2} + 0.73 \text{ play\_hours\_3} + 0.88 \text{ play\_hours\_4} + 1.27 \text{ play\_hours\_5} + \\
& 0.30 \text{ year2013} \times \text{play\_home} + \\
& 0.18 \text{ play\_home} \times \text{ play\_hours\_2} + 0.06 \text{ play\_home} \times \text{ play\_hours\_3} + \\
& 0.02 \text{ play\_home} \times \text{ play\_hours\_4} - 0.44 \text{ play\_home} \times \text{ play\_hours\_5}

$$

- Let's separate into two models: 

    - one for games that I can play at home (minimum player count of no more than 2 players); play_home = 1, 
    - and another for games I cannot play at home (minimum player count of 3 or more); play_home=0.
    
## play_home=1

$$

- What we have learned about interactions holds true *regardless* of the type of modeling we are doing.

    - We may not explicitly talk about interactions in the future, however, it is valid to be asked to include them in models.

- Remember for testing interactions: 

    - `summary()` 
    
        - overall for continuous $\times$ continuous
        - overall for binary $\times$ continuous
        - pairwise comparisons against the reference group(s)
    
    - `car::Anova()` 
    
        - overall for categorical ($c\ge3$) $\times$ continuous
        - overall for categorical ($c\ge3$) $\times$ categorical ($c\ge2$)
